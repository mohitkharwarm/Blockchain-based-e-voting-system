# Blockchain-based-e-voting-system
This Blockchain-based e-voting system can resolve many problems like privacy, trust, security, and feasibility. It is a decentralized system, therefore manipulation of votes is hard, and it can be a faster way to conduct an election because we can see or show the real-time votes cast in favor of a candidate. The Blockchain system is more secure and transparent. Also, this is an online voting system that can save the usage of paper.
